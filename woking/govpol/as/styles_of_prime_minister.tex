	Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister between 1979 and 1990.  She was an egoistic and innovative leader.  She privatised many functions.
	
	John Major took over from Margaret Thatcher and assumed the role of a balancer: ``ensuring peace and stability are maintainted''.  Margaret Thatcher resigned and he was the next candidate to take over: he had a lot to compete with after her.
	
	Tony Blair was elected for the Labour Party in 1997, with many voters discontent after many years of Conservative government and needing change and requesting it in the Election.  He was a reformer: many new reforms and goals, such as the introduction of the National Minimum Wage.
