		\item{Parties are crucial in government formation because, in order to form a strong, represntative government, a lot of people have to assemble and take on ministerial roles, and if people with the same views were not united, they would not know who to trust, not knowing if anyone else supports their views openly, and arguments would break out and so decisions would not be made quickly, effectively, or potentially at all.}
		\item{Parties are crucial for effective leadership and law-making because, if the government was not united in its views, it would be difficult to make laws, and so it could not be said to be legitimate or accountable.}

		\item{A vote of no confidence can be called by any MP if they do not think that the government is doing well, or they do not have confidence in the government.  It acts as a safety valve.}
