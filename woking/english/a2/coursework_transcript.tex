Princess Anne married here in 1973 (.) for example (2) its style is gothic but that has no bearing (.) on the light, bright, happy atmosphere that was contained within just now (.) before they burst out to the raptuous cheering (.) of the many proud Britons lining the streets (1) Pippa Middleton (.) Her Royal Highness's sister (.) stumbles slightly as she picks up the dress (.) but everything is now progressing wonderfully as they reach the end of the carpet with bridesmaids in tow (.) with Kate holding a bouquet containing Lily of the Valley and also a flower called Sweet William which (1) well (.) is quite sweet (1) William takes time putting on his gloves (2) then they carefully climb the steps of the carriage (.) photographers eager to get shots of Kate in a stunning satin dress (1) the lace over which was handmade (1) and William is wearing a red uniform (.) that of the Irish Guards (.) captain of the Blues and Royals (.) with aiguillettes (2) the gold cords hanging down (1) being captain in the Royal Navy (.) he is entitled to wear any of the junior ranking service uniforms (.) but he has chosen the most senior uniform he could have worn (3) now Her Royal Highness climbing each step daintily (.) as she is careful not to damage the dress that people will be talking about for months to come (1) a short pause as the horses get ready (.) then they're off (.) Kate's beaming smile and slightly ginger wave touches the hearts of people around them (.) reminding them that she is not from royal descent (.) and that this is all new to her as well (1) standing to the side (.) not wanting to steal the limelight (.) is the Queen (.) she stands (.) waiting (.) very very proud of her grandson (.) opposite a thousand tourists most likely and some frisky horses (.) as the carriage trots past (2) the happy couple still waving (2) they're moving down the mall (.) which is decorated with British flags (.) and just out of camerashot (.) William salutes the general (.) along with the dutchess bowing her head as a mark of respect which she has been taught to do (1) this is truly a remarkable day that has seen the British people come together (2) we're going to take a short break now for the news but (.) please stay with us (.) for in about five minutes we will rejoin this glorious ceremony (.) in the meantime if your family are not some of the million people (.) million (.) lining the streets of London but instead are holding a street party today to help your community come together (.) why not tweet or email us about it.
