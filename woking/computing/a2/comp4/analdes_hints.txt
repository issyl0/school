0.0.0 - Don't forget a cover/title page!

1.1.2 - Much more detail about exactly which documentation needs to be
kept.

1.2.1.3/4 - Include samples of existing documentation/forms/reports/etc.

1.2.1.5 - Data Flow Diagrams aren't actually DFDs... DFD shows the
sources/destinations of data, major processing items, and how the data
moves between them all. Such as http://spot.colorado.edu/~kozar/dfdsds.gif

See page 236-238 in the textbook.

The existing diagrams are very pretty, though. ;-)

1.2.3 - I'm pretty sure this can either be skipped entirely if 1.2.1.5 is
done correctly, or just condensed down to a simple list/table of places
that data comes from/goes (ie the square boxes in a DFD). 

1.2.4 - Entity Relationship Diagrams. Just make up any old bollocks. Take
major items from your analysis so far and draw some arrows between them.
One Customer can have many Components, one Supplier supplies many
components, each component only hasone supplier, etc... 

1.2.5 - I think some more words in this section wouldn't hurt. What you've
got is good, it just needs expanding upon. *why* is it open to data entry
duplication/error, etc... 

1.2.7 - See 1.2.1.5

1.2.8 - See 1.2.3

1.6 - Consider the VB solution along with the other two. A few more words
might not hurt either.

2.1 - Right sort of diagram, but the shapes need work. Look at the diagram
on p249 of the textbook.

2.2 - As far as I can tell this diagram is meant to be basically a
flowchart showing how your forms link together. I don't have a clue what
your diagram is showing, but again it's very pretty. :P IIRC it also needs
to be in more "technical" language, so the names of forms should be how
they are in the code - frmCustomer, or whatever.

2.4 - See 1.2.9

2.14 - Needs rewriting completely... Look at the testing section of the
textbook (p259), particularly the different testing strategies. Talk about
which one(s) you're "going" to use, and just make it  bit more technical...
