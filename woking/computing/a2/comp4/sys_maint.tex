\chapter{System Maintenance}

	\section{System overview}
	
	The system is written in Visual Basic.NET and consists of four
major sections: the adding, deleting and listing of customers, suppliers
and components into or from a database, and the production of reports.

	There are nineteen forms that consist of buttons, textboxes and
labels, most of which are named quite clearly.  The code is split into
procedures and functions, many of which control the buttons.  The user
enters data into or selects data from the menus in the form and then
clicks whichever button he or she wants to, usually the `OK' or `Save'
button and rarely the cancel button once all the data has been entered into
the textboxes.

	The database which the data is added into, removed from, or
obtained from for the purposes of listing is a Microsoft Access database
which is queried with runtime SQL queries and consists of four tables:
Login, Customer, Supplier, and Component.  The login details are
static: they do not change and cannot be removed or edited from anywhere
in the program, just in the database which it is assumed that the user will
not want to touch.  The Customer table contains the customer details, and
the Supplier and Component details contain the supplier and component
details.  The program controls adding data to and removing and listing
data from the tables, according to what the user chooses to do.
	
	All but one of the reports, the incomplete plain Visual Basic form
named `frmSurveyForm', displays the report in Microsoft Word.  The reports
for logs, quotations and invoices are opened in Microsoft Word.  The log
form is the easiest to understand in that the user just has to select a
month and a year and the respective Microsoft Word document named
`log\_[month][year].docx' is opened.  For the quotations and invoices, some
more complicated processing happens---the word `magic' in the
WordQuotationAutomationMagic() and WordInvoiceAutomationMagic() in procedure
names is testament to that!  The quotations and invoices have data selected
from the database using `SELECT [required fields] FROM [specific table]'
runtime SQL queries, of which the output is assigned to variables with cryptic
names that only I can remember what they stand for (see the variable
lists!), then input into Word paragraph objects and displayed with some
formatting such as font size and centering that is also coded and not done
in Word.

			\hline
		\end{longtable}
	\end{center}
	
	\subsection{Reports}
	
There are no reports generated by the program itself, in the program: data is just piped into Microsoft Word documents.
	
	\section{A sample of detailed algorithm design}
	
	Algorithm to check whether the user-entered email address contains `@', therefore if it is valid or not.
	
	\begin{algorithmic}	
		\State $pos \gets 0$
		\State $etb \gets txtCustomerEmail.Text$
		\State $atsymbol \gets '@'$
        \State $pos \gets InStr(etb, atsymbol)$
        \If {$pos = 0$}
            \State $ErrorYesNo \gets True$
            \State $intInsert \gets 0$\\
            $Box("Input\ a\ valid\ email\ address!")$
        \Else\\
             $ErrorYesNo \gets False$
        \EndIf	
	\end{algorithmic}

	%Bubble sort for the customers, also implemented for suppliers and components by changing `cust\_name' to `supp\_name' and `comp\_name' respectively, just not included here for brevity:
	%\begin{algorithmic}
	%	\Repeat
	%		\State $swapped \gets false$
	%		\For {$i \gets 0 \to length(cust\_name) - 1$}
	%			\If {$cust\_name[i - 1] > cust\_name[i]$}
	%				\State $swap(cust\_name[i - 1], cust\_name[i])$
	%				\State $swapped \gets true$
	%			\EndIf
	%		\EndFor
	%	\Until $swapped \gets false$ 
	%\end{algorithmic}
	
	All other algorithms defined in the Design section have stayed essentially the same.
