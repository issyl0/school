``Killing is one of the worst of all crimes because it takes away all value of that person's future.''

Respect for life can be moral based.

I think that abortion can be good in the case of:
\begin{itemize}
\item{rape of mother}
\item{mother at risk}
\item{severe disability of child}
\end{itemize}

Human Rights always dominate the abortion debate.  Legal problem?  When does humanity exist?  Example: only at birth.

People transpose normal human rights onto the unborn child.

May stand out as a moral/religious argument but will fail as a legal one.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948: \textbf{``Everyone has the right to life...''}.

The right to life is the most fundamental right to a human being.  That is why people feel so strongly about abortion.  Even those who decide to have an abortion would not find the decision easy to make because a pregnant woman is separating potential life from her body.

``I have come to believe that those who support abortion on demand do so because in all sincerity they cannot accept that an unborn baby is a human being.'' --- \textit{Jill Knight, MP, 1966}.
