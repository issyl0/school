Patriarchal society --- ruled by men.

Not until 1992 were women allowed to become priests in the Anglican Church.  Now there is the debate about women being allowed to be Bishops.

Mary Warren stopped backstreet abortions by legalising abortion.

In law, a woman has a right to control her body.

\textit{Differing views on abortion}

Artistotle favoured abortion to limit the size of families --- this is birth control by abortion.  It does not regard the foetus as special in any way.

Artistote clashed with the medics' Hippocratic oath which says all doctors should strive to save life, not take it.

The traditional religious view (generally) is that all life is sacred.

The foetus, for many people, may be regarded as human and therefore deserves respect.

Some people say the unborn child is only potentially human.

It will lead to an Absolutist --- Relativist view.

We must remember that abortion issues deeply affect the lives of peopl who need to be treated astorally with sensitivity and care.

Excommunication -- banned from the Church: the main reason is \textsl{heresy} = speaking an untruth about a religion.
