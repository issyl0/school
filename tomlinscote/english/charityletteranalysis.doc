Analysis of English coursework charity letter.

My English media text is a charity letter for the homeless charity Crisis.  It is aimed at families or people with income and it was sent to everyone to try to raise funds for the charity Crisis.  I used some linguistic devices such as rhetorical questions.  I tried to persuade readers to give 'just two pounds a month' to help the homeless at Christmas time.

The linguistic devices I used were rhetorical questions which would make people hopefully think in a positive way and want to help the charity.  I used a couple of personal stories and experiences, such as the boy Thomas who lived on the streets with 'only a few pieces of cardboard' and the young Polish boy whose mother had a heroin addiction that Crisis helped her to overcome.

The presentational devices I used were the charity name, a slogan ("we are committed to helping the homeless get their lives back on track'), a footer at the bottom of the page with a fictional charity number, email and postal address, name of the director and the telephone/fax numbers.
